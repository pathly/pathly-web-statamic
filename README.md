# Statamic V3 Starter
Statamic Starter is a Docker development environment to make [Statamic V3](https://www.statamic.com) development even more fun and easy. This is all you need to easily build a Statamic website using Apache and PHP 7.4.

This setup is currently tested on macOS.

## Requirements

* Docker Engine >= 20.10.3
* Docker Compose >= 1.28.5

[Download Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

## Installation

To quickly get started, first open your shell and go to the directory where you want to have the project located.
Now you can run the following commands:


``` 
git clone git@github.com:pathly/pathly-web-statamic.git
cd pathly-web-statamic
docker-compose up
```

Wait until you see the output `Statamic is ready`. Now everything is installed.

Open a browser of your choice and access your new local Statamic website:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

To stop the process just press CTRL + C

## Statamic Development

To run [CLI](https://statamic.dev/cli) get an interactive prompt first:

```
docker-compose exec statamic bash
```

Run `php artisan` or `php please` inside the statamic service.

Alternatively, the commands can also be executed directly on the host.

```
docker-compose exec statamic php please
```

## Build Images
Of course you can modify the existing `Dockerfile`. These are located inside `images/*/Dockerfile`. To build the images you can run the `build.sh` script using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

```
npm run build
```
